### Current Course

I'm currently taking STAT 385 Statistics Programming Methods. It is a course about programming in R. So far, we have learned many topics such as Data Type, Vectorizing and plotting. Here are some codes we learned: 

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(x=faithful$waiting,main = "Histogram of Waiting Time",xlab = "Waiting Time (mins)",ylab = "Density",border = "dodgerblue", probability = TRUE)
box()
grid()
plot(x=faithful$waiting,y=faithful$eruptions,main = "Waiting Time vs. Eruption Time",col="blue",xlab = "Waiting Time (min)",ylab = "Erupyion Time (min)",pch=16)
box()
grid()
```
